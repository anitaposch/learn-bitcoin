## Strategic Notes

### Words of Warning

**Before you get into buying Bitcoin, please read these important notes:**

This guide covers the first Bitcoin blockchain, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, which operates under the acronym BTC or XBT on exchanges. For information about Bitcoin (BTC), see [https://bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/). On [http://bitcoin.com,](http://bitcoin.com/) on the other hand, you reach the website of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is a split off from 2017.

Be aware that there are many spin-offs of the original Bitcoin. They have names like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) or Bitcoin 2 (BTC2). These are not "cheaper" bitcoin, but independent, different assets. They use the same name as Bitcoin to benefit from its notoriety, but do not maintain the same strengths or popularity as the real Bitcoin (BTC).

Bitcoin is a common good, without trademark rights. If you were to start a company today and call it "Apple Premium", you would receive a lawsuit for trademark infringement from Apple very quickly. This does not apply to Bitcoin because it is open source, which promotes innovation and inclusion. In the case of naming a spin-off something like Bitcoin Cash, it is confusing and should be avoided.

The use of Bitcoin is legal in most countries of the world, but a state ban could come into force at any time, theoretically preventing the use of Bitcoin by individuals. In any case, a ban could result in a loss of value and switching your bitcoin back into fiat currencies could be difficult. Since the core Bitcoin community are highly committed users, even if your country bans bitcoin, you will always find someone who will happily exchange your bitcoin for fiat.

The price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. It is possible at any time - and has also happened several times - that the price drops sharply in a short time and you cannot withdraw or exchange your bitcoin as quickly as desired.

Use only as much money as you can lose without getting into financial problems. You are responsible for the safe custody of your capital. In case of loss or theft, there is no recovery option.

In addition to bitcoin, there are more than 4,000 other crypto assets to date, all of which have different objectives and uses. Learn more about the intentions, the team and the technology behind it before you invest, if at all.

The emergence of these other assets can affect the price of bitcoin. Another currency could become the leading digital currency, although currently most of the acceptance and growth is within Bitcoin (BTC).

Don't get carried away with quick promotions because someone is giving you a "get rich quick" offer and promises to buy and manage coins for you. Unfortunately, many people play nasty games and stage multi-level marketing offers, or [Ponzi schemes](https://anita.link/ponzi).

If someone asks you to "join" Bitcoin or is writing "BitCoin", be aware. You don't need to join anything to use Bitcoin, there is no need to buy an entry package or anything like that - these are most likely scams.

If you are waiting to buy a Bitcoin ETF, you won't own bitcoin and won't use bitcoin. You will only be exposed to the price action. You only own and control your bitcoin if you manage your private keys yourself. You can find out how to do this on the following pages.
