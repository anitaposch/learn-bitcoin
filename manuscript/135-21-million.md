## 21 Million Bitcoin
Bitcoin are created, as described in the previous pages, when a mining computer solves a computational task and is the first to successfully attach the newly minted block to the chain.

Miners currently receive a premium of 6.25 bitcoin for this work. This reward is the incentive for miners to behave positively towards the Bitcoin network and not cheat to change transactions in their favor.

### Halving
The Bitcoin rules stipulate that the reward for the miners will be halved every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years. At the beginning this reward was 50 bitcoin. Since May 2020 it is 6.25 bitcoin. In 2024 this reward will be halved into 3.125 bitcoin per block. This event is commonly called the Halving.

Satoshi Nakamoto coded these halvings into the Bitcoin Core software. The output quantity decreases over time, resulting in a flattening supply curve.

This algorithm tends to zero such that there will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin. There are currently around 18.7 million in circulation. In 2140 all 21 million bitcoin will have been generated. Mining will continue and the miners will be rewarded solely with transaction fees. By that point, it is expected that Bitcoin as a network will have such high adoption that transaction fees alone will adequately facilitate fair reward for miners.

### Why 21 Million?
Why did Satoshi Nakamoto choose 21 million for the supply cap? There are many theories, but here is Satoshi's answer:

### Bitcoin Units
The smallest denomination unit of a bitcoin is a satoshi. 1 bitcoin is comprised of 100,000,000 satoshis; 1 satoshi is one hundred millionth of 1 bitcoin (0.00000001).

You do not have to buy or sell 1 bitcoin at a time, you can start small and transact a minuscule fraction of it.

### Bitcoin or bitcoin, but Never BitCoin

Bitcoin with a capital B is used when referring to the Bitcoin network, the blockchain, the community and the concept as a whole, whereas bitcoin with a lowercase b is used to reference the currency, the bitcoin token. 

In fact, coin is the wrong term to describe the digital asset, it is a little bit misleading. In technical terms it is called UTXO - unspent transaction output. A UTXO defines the amount of value that is stored on the blockchain at a specific Bitcoin address. Therefore there are diverging opinions as to if there is a plural for bitcoin, the unit, because it's fluid and there are no set individual coins. But since Satoshi Nakamoto spoke of bitcoins, we as a community name it that way too. There is no plural for Bitcoin, as there is only one blockchain and network.

Scams like the BitClub network referred to it as BitCoin and this is often mistakenly used by Bitcoin beginners too.
