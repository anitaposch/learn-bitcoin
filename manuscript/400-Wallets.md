## Wallet Types

There are different types of wallets depending on the device, security requirements and supported cryptocurrencies. To decide which wallet is best for you I will provide some thoughts and industry standards as guidance. Ultimately, you have to decide which wallet is the best for you. Since Bitcoin is such a novel technology, wallet software is changing constantly. You need to consider that you will need to do upgrades and sometimes change the wallet manufacturer because of new functionalities, there are constantly new wallets on the market. This should not turn you off, I just want to make you aware of it. In the last few years, I used more and more wallets to test them or to be able to use new functionalities. Therefore I will recommend wallets that I have used myself and that have a very good reputation among industry experts.

### Wallet Security

The better protected a wallet's software is from outside attacks over the internet, the more secure it is. Therefore, the basic categorization is between hot storage and cold storage solutions. Hot wallets, like mobile wallets and desktop wallets, are apps that connect to the internet and are therefore at risk from hackers, viruses or regulatory and counter-party risks. Cold storage solutions like hardware wallets are never online and therefore are much more secure.

Additionally, your smartphone, whether Android or iOS, is more secure than your laptop or PC. Desktop Windows systems are less secure than Apple devices at the time of writing. Within the different smartphone operating systems, there are fewer differences in the level of security.

On top of these considerations, you need to use a wallet that supports your favorite cryptocurrencies. Since this is a BTC guide, I suggest you use a bitcoin-only wallet. The more cryptocurrencies a software such as a wallet app has to handle, the more complex the development and maintenance of the software is from the manufacturer's end. More complexity brings higher risks of bugs and vulnerabilities.

In the years since Bitcoin's release, using a hardware wallet has proven to be the best way to store your private keys. A hardware wallet is a small device that stores private keys offline, similar to a USB stick.

Hardware wallets require maintenance and a computer or smartphone. If you don't want to worry about software updates, or do not own such a device, you can use the Card Wallet as a cold storage alternative. It is a product by the oldest Austrian bitcoin broker Coinfinity and the Austrian State Printing House.

### Industry Standards
In each case, you need to trust the wallet manufacturers to a higher or lesser degree. The **industry's preferred and recommended cold storage solutions are hardware wallets**.

Depending on the amount your wallet has to manage, it is standard to use a combination of **a smartphone wallet for small amounts that you want to have with you on the go** and **hardware wallets for large amounts like savings in your bank account**.

If your bitcoin funds reach an amount that you would rather have secured to an even higher degree, then you should look for multi-signature solutions. But be aware: Multi-sig solutions are **not for beginners**! You really need to know what you are doing.

As an alternative, you can use a company called Casa and their industry-leading multi-sig solutions. Or you can get several hardware wallets to split your funds onto more devices, which lowers the risk of device or manufacturer flaws.

**Desktop Wallets**
Because of the security risks stated above, I don't use software wallets on my computer, except for when I use them in combination with hardware wallets. For this, I use Sparrow or the hardware manufacturer's native software.

### Cold Storage
**Hardware Devices**

Hardware wallet devices securely manage your coins, Bitcoin addresses, and private keys, keeping them offline. Even if your device is compromised by malware or has been hacked, your funds are safe and you can send and receive payments. You need to manually confirm transactions on these external devices and this ensures that no intruder on your computer can take over your funds.

The following manufacturers and devices have established themselves in the hardware wallet market in recent years. SatoshiLabs from Prague has been producing hardware wallets since 2014. Swiss Shift Crypto AG has been on the market with the BitBox since 2015. Canadian company Coinkite has been manufacturing the Coldcard since 2018 and Canada/USA based Blockstream's Jade is out since 2021.

I have tested and used all of the listed devices. The BitBox02 is my favorite. It looks like a simple USB device and offers many security features. The advantage of Trezor models (3, 5, 7) is their option to split the wallet backup into multiple 20-word shares, for enhanced security and resilience. The Coldcard is for tech-savvy users and the Jade not only secures Bitcoin, but also Liquid funds (Bitcoin's sidechain with improved privacy). 

I do not recommend Ledger devices. The company has demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness over the years. They have [experienced several data leaks](https://cryptoslate.com/new-ledger-breach-didnt-steal-your-crypto-but-it-exposed-the-one-thing-that-leads-criminals-to-your-door/), exposing thousands of customers' personal details.

Always buy hardware wallets directly from the manufacturer's website, their authorized Amazon store, or a trusted dealer. Never buy a hardware wallet from strangers on eBay, Amazon or second-hand. Verify that the device is sealed as described on the manufacturer's website. Most recommended devices have tamper-evident packaging to prevent tampering. Note that no manufacturer ships devices with pre-generated seeds; if you receive one, it's likely a scam and not safe to use.

## Privacy Recommendations

During the purchasing process do not use your residential address or your real name! Instead, use a postbox, packing station, or other secure address to protect your private data. Use a disposable email address with a fake name and avoid adding your real phone number. Your data may leak and be associated with a Bitcoin wallet purchase. Crypto owners have been targeted in [house invasions, robberies, kidnappings, even murder](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2026/crypto-users-face-home-invasions-as-physical-attacks-double/), forcing them to surrender their Bitcoin.

This is why KYC, "Know-Your-Customer" procedures where you need to verify your identity through facial recognition and uploading your ID to service providers is endangering Bitcoin users and why some refer to it as "Kill-Your-Customer" regulation. Since identity verification is not required for hardware wallet purchases, protect yourself by using a fake name.

When purchasing online, your payment data will be associated with the supplier. To protect your privacy, consider paying with Bitcoin or buying from a local dealer with cash. Bitcoin conferences also offer a private way to purchase hardware devices.

In addition to the device, the vendors provide wallet software to manage your coins on your computer or mobile. For privacy reasons, some users prefer to use the vendor's wallet only for initial setup and maintenance, such as recording their seed phrase (your wallet's recovery words) and updating firmware, and then use a more secure wallet like Sparrow or Electrum to manage their transactions. 

**Offline wallets**
**Paper Wallet**
On the internet, you will find recommendations for using paper wallets. They are self-generated bitcoin addresses with their private and public keys that you can print out on paper. Since you generate and print them out yourself, you do not have to spend money on them. But, they are difficult to generate securely. The security measures that you need to take are extremely high. **I advise against using them**.

Really, if you do not want to pay the 50 - 100 USD required to buy a hardware wallet to secure higher amounts than you carry around comfortably on your phone, then you should reconsider using bitcoin as a store of value in the first place.

If you simply cannot afford a hardware wallet, use your phone in the meantime. As soon as you have saved enough funds, get yourself a hardware wallet.

**Card Wallet**
The Card Wallet (product) is in principle a paper wallet, but it is produced by professionals with high security standards. However, you need to trust the manufacturers to not record the private keys to the card. You can use the Card Wallet as an alternative if you do not own a computer or smartphone or do not want to take care of the maintenance of your hardware wallet. https://cardwallet.com/anita (my readers get 20% off)

The industry preferred and **recommended cold storage solution are hardware wallets**.
